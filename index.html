	The year end festive season is a great time for meet-ups with friends and family over meals üôÇ But it also means that when it comes to the end of the gathering and you need to settle the bill, that there are often awkward glances wondering ‚Äú Erm, who‚Äôs gonna pay first?‚Äù. And the unfortunate task of splitting the bill is usually given to the one who volunteered to foot the bill! üòê
Well, realising this is an all too common pain point (be it festive season or not!) for all food loving Singaporeans, I decided to put my UX skills out for a spin to work on a split bill app! Would love your feedback and comments! And any developers out there who want to do this for real?
